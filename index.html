        <h2>Why Git?</h2>
        <p>
            Git is a powerful version control system that lets me track changes to my code, experiment with new features 
            safely, and collaborate with others more effectively. By learning Git, I'm ensuring that I can manage my projects 
            with confidence and reduce the risk of losing work.

            <li>Understand the basics of version control</li>

            <li>Create and manage branches to explore new ideas</li>
